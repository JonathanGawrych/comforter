# Comforter
When your code is covered, you feel warm and cozy inside

### Purpose
Comforter helps you feel good that the changes you made to a project didn't cause anyone any pain.  It makes sure that any change you make is a positive one, which gives everyone the warm fuzzies.

### Setup Dev Environment
Make sure you have `npm` and `node` installed, as well as `vagrant` and virtual box.

`vagrant up`  
`npm install -g generator-ng-gulp` (used for generating front-end components)  
`npm install`  
`npm start`  

In some other terminal window  
`gulp serve`

Start deving away
